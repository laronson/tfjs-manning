      <p>
        This example shows you how to perform regression with more than one input feature using the
        <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html">Boston Housing Dataset</a>,
        which is a famous dataset derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing
        in the area of Boston Massachusetts.
      </p>
      <p>
        It allows you to compare the performance of 3 different models for predicting the house prices. When training
        the linear model, it will also display the largest 5 weights (by absolute value) of the model and
        the feature associated with each of those weights.
